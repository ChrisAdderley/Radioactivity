RADIOACTIVITY v0.1.0

A mod about radiation!

============
DEPENDENCIES
============

Required:
- ModuleManager (2.6.25)

I recommend removing any previous versions of Radioactivity before installing an update.

To install, place the GameData folder inside your Kerbal Space Program folder. If asked to overwrite files, do so.
